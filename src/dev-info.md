### Version 1
The first version of the app is finally ready. This app interface has a input promt on the top of the screen for users to pass keywords of the quired images. Then the app takes those keywords after user hits enter and sends a request to https://api.unsplash.com/ for image results. The app takes unsplash results and maps those below the search promt.
