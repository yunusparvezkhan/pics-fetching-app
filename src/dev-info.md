### Version 1
The first version of the app is finally ready. This app interface has a input promt on the top of the screen for users to pass keywords of the quired images. Then the app takes those keywords after user hits enter and sends a request to https://api.unsplash.com/ for image results. The app takes unsplash results and maps those below the search promt.
## Version 1 efficiency patch-001
In this patch update, all the unneccessary codes that were written during product R&D were cleared. Hopefully it makes the app a little bit more efficient.
